# Through Every Season (MVP)

**Through Every Season (TES)** helps viewers jump into any season of a TV show while still understanding the story.  
Instead of watching every episode, TES recommends a **minimal set of episodes per season**, adjustable by immersion level.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> tes && cd tes
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up --build
```
